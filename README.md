Analyzing the genre of No.1 hits on Hot 100 chart of Billboard
- Because the nature of this chart, Pop (green) dominates the chart without question
- Prior 2010, R&B/Soul and HipHop/Rap are as popular as Pop. But recently, 
there are much more less R&B/Soul No.1 hits.
- After 2017, we see the climb of alternative and country. 
Thanks to "Old Town Road" and Billie Eilish...

*limitation
- There are missing song ID information when merge the billboard hot-100
& spotify dataset,therefore some years don't have 52 weeks song data.
